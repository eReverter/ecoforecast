### Assumptions

- When aggregating the data into hourly ranges, should I consider that some quarters might have missing values? Or should I just consider missing values AFTER the aggregation?

    - Nevermind, I will consider missing values BEFORE the aggregation.

- Should I check for outliers?
    
        - IMO, in forecasting outliers are not really relevant. I will not check for outliers until the final dataset is ready.

- Feature engineering?

    - Makes no sense since the test data only has green energy and load energy. Not more metadata.
